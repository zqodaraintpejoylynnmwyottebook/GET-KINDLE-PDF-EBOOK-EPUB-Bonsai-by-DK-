Bonsai by DK Book Review

Title: The one book you should get if you're new to bonsai!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020
Review: This book is beautifully designed and full of info about every aspect of Bonsai: soil, pots, plant types, specific care, what to do in every season, roots over rocks, mesh, wiring, flowering plants, fruit-bearing plants, root care, tools, etc. As a newbie, this book has everything I wanted to know and more. And did I mention the beautiful layout and gorgeous photography? It deserves a second mention! I plan on getting the other books sold here, because I love looking at images of expertly manicured bonsai for inspiration, but I'm glad this was the first one I procured.

Title: Really great Bonzai book!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021
Review: I originally stumbled upon this book in a book store, didn't get it then but after a few days decided to check Amazon and it was quite a bit cheaper. Anyways, this book is a great guide to bonzai care, potting, wiring etc. It also has some awesome pictures of bonzai's from different areas. The bottom line is if you want a great companion on your bonzai journey get this book!

Title: DK scores with this Bonsai book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018
Review: I've long been a collector/grower of dwarf conifers, and decided that I wanted to try my hand at Bonsai. There are a lot of books out there on the subject but it's easy to go into information overload. The DK book cuts through the noise and presents a very comprehensive, step-wise approach to Bonsai for the beginner. It not only shows the options for growing and styling Bonsai but gives excellent well-annotated examples of everything from starting from seedling or whip to growing root-over-rock to creating a forest stand. There is an excellent species dataset in the back that captures a lot of information in a handy, easy to retrieve form. I'm very pleased with this book that will guide me through my apprenticeship as a Bonsai gardener.

Title: The best modern Bonsai book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020
Review: This book is excellent for all levels of Bonsai. I have had my plants for a few years and have researched different techniques and how to troubleshoot different issues. Ultimately, this book gives you a great overview of Bonsai with very detailed pictures. This book is great for advanced users as well.

Title: Pretty pictures; Not much useful content
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021
Review: I purchased this book hoping for ‚ÄúTechniques ‚óè Styles‚Äù like the cover claims it contains. The only useful information in Bonsai is general information you can find with a simple internet search. Everything else just a bunch of pictures of bonsai trees. If you want to actually learn something, like how to create deadwood, even an amateur YouTube video would probably be more useful. I gave it an extra star because it‚Äôs wiring section is adequate‚Äîa YouTube video would probably still be more useful though.
